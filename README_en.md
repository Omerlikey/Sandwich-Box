Sandwich Box

English | "‰∏≠Êñá" (README_zh.md)

An open-source hardware platform that redefines edge computing and smart home hubs.
The 
"Sandwich Box" is a groundbreaking modular computing platform built on a core design philosophy of a "heterogeneous architecture" that separates the brain from the limbs. It combines powerful main processors to manage global tasks with a vast cluster of ESP32-S3 co-processors to handle high-concurrency I/O, offering an unparalleled all-in-one development platform for smart homes, industrial automation, edge AI, and developers.


‚ú® Core Features

üß† Powerful "Brain" (Main Computing Unit)

* Options:
   * Pro/Industrial Edition: Dual Rockchip RK3588 SoCs for top-tier computing power.
   * Home Edition: One SoC for a balance of performance and power efficiency.
* Runs a full Linux system with Docker support for easy deployment of complex applications.
* Rich I/O: Gigabit/2.5G Ethernet, multiple USB ports, HDMI output, PCIe x4 expansion.

ü¶æ Unlimited "Limbs" (Co-processing Unit)

* Expandable cluster of ESP32-S3 co-processors connected via a custom backplane.
* Each ESP32-S3 acts as an independent real-time processing unit, dedicated to high-concurrency, low-latency tasks like sensor data acquisition and device control.
* High-speed communication between the main unit and co-processors via USB or Ethernet.

üß© Modular Design

* Core Board + Functional Backplane structure allows for future core upgrades.
* Open expansion card slots for community-developed add-ons (LoRa, Zigbee, motor drivers, PoE, etc.).

üöÄ Application Scenarios

* Ultimate Smart Home Hub: Manages all home devices locally, runs Home Assistant, cloud-optional.
* Industrial Edge Gateway: Collects data from PLCs and sensors, performs protocol conversion and edge AI inference.
* Media Center: 4K video playback and game streaming, powered by the capable SoC.
* Developer & Hacker's Dream Platform: Offers ultimate flexibility and performance for IoT, robotics, and automation projects.
* Educational Platform: The perfect hardware for learning Linux, embedded systems, networking, and distributed computing.

üìñ Project Status & Roadmap

This project is in its early development stage. We are actively working on hardware schematic design and community building.

* Phase 1: Complete v1 schematic design (In Progress)
* Phase 2: PCB layout, prototyping, and debugging
* Phase 3: Basic software system and firmware development
* Phase 4: First developer kit testing
* Phase 5: Official open-source release and community promotion
